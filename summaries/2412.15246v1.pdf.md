## Abstract Summary

* **Background:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a solution to enhance large language models (LLMs) with non-parametric knowledge, retrieving information from external sources to improve accuracy and address hallucination.
* **Problem:** High-quality retrieval in RAG applications is crucial for effective performance, but it accounts for a significant portion of end-to-end runtime and current applications are bottlenecked by this phase.
* **Methodology:** The study introduces Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a specialized CXL-based memory expander with low-profile accelerators for vector database search. IKS is designed to accelerate ENNS operations and optimize RAG applications by leveraging near-memory acceleration.
* **Key Findings:**
   - IKS accelerates ENNS for a 512GB knowledge store by 13.4‚Äì27.9√ó, leading to a 1.7‚Äì26.3√ó end-to-end inference speedup for RAG applications.
   - IKS outperforms GPUs in ENNS retrieval for specific batch sizes and corpus sizes, achieving 2.6√ó to 4.6√ó speedup.
   - The retrieval time of IKS does not change with the value of K, and it consistently returns 32 top similarity scores.
   - IKS significantly reduces ENNS retrieval time, with end-to-end inference time speedup ranging from 5.6 to 25.6√ó for various models.
* **Conclusion:** The study demonstrates that IKS effectively addresses the retrieval bottleneck in RAG applications, improving accuracy, latency, and throughput. IKS's near-memory acceleration architecture and specialized design for ENNS operations make it a promising solution for optimizing RAG systems.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | ENNS (Exact Nearest Neighbor Search) is superior to ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search) in terms of generation accuracy and end-to-end throughput for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. | High-quality retrieval methods like ENNS can reduce generation time when high accuracy is required. |

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$ùë†ùëë=ùê∏ùëû(ùëû)¬∑ùê∏ùëë(ùëë)$$ | Calculates the similarity score between a document and a query. | This equation is central to the dense retrieval process in RAG, where the goal is to find the most relevant documents for a given query. The similarity score is used to rank documents and retrieve the top ones, which are then fed into the generative model. The accuracy of this score directly impacts the quality of the retrieved information and, consequently, the accuracy of the generated output. |
| $$ùëõlayers √óùëõKV-heads √óùëëhead √óùëõbytes √ó2$$ | Computes the memory required to store a key-value cache entry for a single token in the context of transformer inference. | This equation highlights the memory overhead associated with storing retrieved documents in the generative model. As the number of retrieved documents (K) increases, the memory requirements grow, impacting the computational efficiency and scalability of RAG systems. Understanding this overhead is crucial for optimizing memory usage and reducing generation times. |
