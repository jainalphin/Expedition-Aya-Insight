| **Publication Venue** | Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies |

| **Keywords** | Abstractive Summarization, Multilingual Dataset, Low-Resource Languages, Human Evaluation, Intrinsic Evaluation |

## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Contemporary works on abstractive text summarization have focused primarily on high-resource languages like English, mostly due to the limited availability of datasets for low/mid-resource ones.
- **Problem:** The limited availability of good datasets conducive to abstractive methods has made it even more difficult.
- **Methodology:** We present XL-Sum, a comprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 1 million professionally annotated article-summary pairs from BBC, extracted using a set of carefully designed heuristics.
- **Key Findings:**
  - The multilingual model outperformed all the models trained on a single language.
  - The low-resource models do not trail by a large margin, in all cases the difference is not more than 2 for R-2 scores.
  - The dataset covers 44 languages ranging from low to high-resource, for many of which no public dataset is currently available.
- **Conclusion:** We hope the XL-Sum dataset will be helpful for the research community, especially for the researchers working to ensure fair access to technological advances to under-served communities with low-resource languages.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | XL-Sum is a large-scale abstractive summarization dataset of news articles crawled from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). | XL-Sum is the largest abstractive summarization dataset in terms of the number of samples collected from a single source and the number of languages covered. |
| 2 | XL-Sum covers 44 languages, ranging from low to high-resource. | For many of the languages, XL-Sum provides the first publicly available abstractive summarization dataset and benchmarks. |
| 3 | XL-Sum is highly abstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic evaluation. | XL-Sum potentially enables and facilitates research on low-resource languages, bringing technological advances to communities of these languages that have been traditionally under-served. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* XL-Sum outperforms previous datasets in terms of size, language coverage, and quality.
* Unlike previous datasets, XL-Sum is collected from a single source, ensuring uniformity in summarization strategies across languages.
* The introduction of XL-Sum addresses the scarcity of good datasets for low-resource languages, a longstanding roadblock in abstractive summarization research.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$\text{CMP}(A, S) = 1 - \frac{|S|}{|A|}\ \text{(Equation 1)}$$ | Measures conciseness by calculating the compression ratio between the summary (S) and the article (A) | Quantifies how much shorter the summary is compared to the original article, ensuring the summary is concise |
| $$\text{RED}(S) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m} (f_i - 1)}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i} = 1 - \frac{m}{|S| - n + 1}\ \text{(Equation 2)}\$$ | Calculates redundancy by measuring the ratio of repeated n-grams to total n-grams in the summary (S) | Ensures the summary has minimal repetition, improving its quality and readability |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Multilingual Abstractive Summarization** | Contemporary works on abstractive text summarization have focused primarily on high-resource languages like English, mostly due to the limited availability of datasets for low/mid-resource ones. Some recent efforts for curating multilingual abstractive summarization datasets (Giannakopoulos et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2020; Scialom et al., 2020) are limited in terms of the number of languages covered, the number of training samples, or both. | We introduce XL-Sum, a large-scale abstractive summarization dataset of news articles crawled from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) website. Using a custom crawler, we collect 1 million professionally annotated article-summary pairs covering 44 languages. XL-Sum is the largest abstractive summarization dataset in terms of the number of samples collected from a single source and the number of languages covered. |
| **Low-Resource Summarization** | Most works on abstractive summarization have so far focused on English, in large part due to a lack of benchmark datasets for other languages. Giannakopoulos et al. (2015) introduced MultiLing 2015, a summarization dataset spanning 40 languages. However, MultiLing 2015 is limited in size, with the training set having only 10k samples in total. Cao et al. (2020); Scialom et al. (2020) introduced two new datasets for multilingual summarization, but both were limited to less than 10 languages. | XL-Sum covers 44 languages ranging from low to high-resource, for many of which no public dataset is currently available. We fine-tune mT5, a state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual model, with XL-Sum and experiment on multilingual and low-resource summarization tasks. XL-Sum induces competitive results compared to the ones obtained using similar monolingual datasets. |
| **Dataset Curation** | The process of automatically collecting summaries of articles differs across different datasets. For example, the CNN/DM dataset (Hermann et al., 2015) merged bullet point highlights provided with the articles as reference summaries, whereas the XSum dataset (Narayan et al., 2018) used the first line of the article as the summary and the rest of the article as the input. | Our method of collecting summaries was made easier by the consistent editorial style of the BBC articles we crawled. BBC typically provides a summary of a whole article in the form of a bold paragraph containing one or two sentences at the beginning of each article. We designed a number of heuristics to make the extraction effective by carefully examining the HTML structures of the crawled pages. |

**Gap Addressed:**
* The limited availability of datasets for low/mid-resource languages in abstractive text summarization.
* The lack of benchmark datasets for other languages besides English in abstractive summarization.
* The need for a large-scale, high-quality multilingual text summarization dataset with a uniform summarization strategy across languages.
* The challenge of collecting summaries for a diverse set of languages with varying resource levels.

## Practical Applications

| Domain/Industry | Potential Use Case or Application | Key Requirements or Dependencies | Feasibility/Timeline (e.g., Short/Med/Long term) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Natural Language Processing** | Automatic text summarization | Input text | Short term |
| **Computational Linguistics** | Abstractive text summarization | Large dataset of article-summary pairs | Short term |
| **Machine Learning** | Training language models | High volume of texts | Short term |
| **Information Retrieval** | Text summarization techniques | Text data | Short term |
| **Neural Machine Translation** | Machine translation evaluation | Translation data | Short term |

**Most Promising Use Case:** Abstractive text summarization in the domain of Computational Linguistics has the highest potential impact and feasibility, as it can be applied to a wide range of languages and tasks, and is supported by the availability of large datasets and advanced language models.

## Limitations & Future Work

**Limitations:**
* **Theoretical:** Conceptual limits of extractive and abstractive summarization approaches
* **Methodological:** Issues with design or procedure
* **Data-Related:** Constraints due to data quality/availability
* Computational constraints

**Future Work Suggestions:**
* Investigate the use of the dataset for other summarization tasks (e.g., cross-lingual summarization)
* Explore new areas or questions for future research based on these findings
* Potential experiments or applications to explore
