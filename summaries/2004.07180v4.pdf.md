| **Authors** | Arman Cohan†∗ Sergey Feldman†∗ Iz Beltagy† Doug Downey† Daniel S. Weld†,‡ |
| **Publication Venue** | arXiv:2004.07180v4 [cs.CL] 20 May 2020 |

| **Keywords** | Document-level Representation Learning, Citation-informed Transformers, SPECTER, SCIDOCS |

## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Pretrained Transformer networks have demonstrated success on various NLP tasks.
- **Problem:** Existing language models (LMs) like BERT are primarily based on masked language modeling objectives, only considering intra-document context and not using any inter-document information.
- **Methodology:** SPECTER uses citations as an inter-document relatedness signal and formulates it as a triplet loss learning objective.
- **Key Findings:**
  - SPECTER outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.
  - SPECTER embeddings offer similar advantages in a live application.
  - SPECTER embeddings are better at encoding topical information.
- **Conclusion:** SPECTER achieves substantial improvements over the strongest of a wide variety of baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | SPECTER outperforms other models | SPECTER's effectiveness and versatility in various tasks without task-specific fine-tuning |
| 2 | Introduction of SCIDOCS | Addresses the need for larger and more diverse benchmark datasets in scientific document representation evaluation |
| 3 | Online A/B test results | Demonstrates SPECTER's superiority in a live application, improving clickthrough rate by 46.5% |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* SPECTER does not require citation information at inference time, unlike many prior works, making it applicable to new, uncited papers.
* Outperforms Citeomatic and SGC, state-of-the-art models, in various tasks like citation prediction and co-citation, even without access to the citation graph at training and test time.
* Unlike models like SGC, SPECTER can be used in real-world settings to embed new, uncited papers, offering more practical applicability.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$v = \text{Transformer(input)}[\text{CLS}]$$ | Document Representation | This equation represents the encoding of a paper's title and abstract using a Transformer LM, such as SciBERT, to produce a dense vector representation of the paper. |
| $$L= \text{max}\left\{\left(d\left(PQ, P^+\right) - d\left(PQ, P^-\right) + m\right), 0\right\}$$ | Triplet Margin Loss Function | This equation defines the loss function used to train the model, encouraging closer representations for cited papers and more distant representations for non-cited papers. |
| $$d(PA, PB) = ||vA - vB||_2$$ | Distance Function | This equation defines the distance function used in the loss function, which is the L2 norm distance between the vector representations of two papers. |

## Technical Details

| Component | Description | Key Configuration or Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| **Algorithm(s)** | Triplet-loss pretraining objective | Margin m=1 |
| **Model/Architecture** | Transformer LM (initialized with SciBERT) | 768-dimensional paper embedding |
| **Implementation** | AllenNLP | Adam optimizer |
| **Performance** | F1 score nDCG MAP | 86.4 F1 score (MeSH dataset) |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Document Representation** | Extensions of word vectors to documents, convolution-based methods, and variational autoencoders. | SPECTER builds embeddings from the title and abstract of a paper, using a Transformer LM to encode the concatenated title and abstract. |
| **Document Embedding** | Sentence embedding, seq2seq models, BiLSTM Siamese networks, leveraging supervised data from other corpora, using discourse relations, and BERT-based methods. | SPECTER does not consider any notion of inter-document relatedness when embedding documents. |
| **Textual Features with Network Structure** | Combining textual features with network structure in various works. | SPECTER uses pretrained language models in combination with graph-based citation signals. |

**Gap Addressed:**
* Document-level representation learning in scientific documents has been relatively under-explored, with existing models not leveraging inter-document relatedness effectively. This paper introduces SPECTER, a model that incorporates inter-document context using citations as a signal of relatedness, while leveraging pretrained language models.

## Practical Applications

| Domain/Industry | Potential Use Case or Application | Key Requirements or Dependencies | Feasibility/Timeline (e.g., Short/Med/Long term) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Academic Research** | Paper Recommendation | Access to a large corpus of scientific papers with citations | Short-term |
| **Academic Research** | Document Classification | Labeled dataset for training and validation | Short-term |
| **Academic Research** | Citation Prediction | Citation graph data | Short-term |
| **Academic Research** | User Activity Prediction | User interaction data (e.g., co-views, co-reads) | Short-term |
| **Academic Research** | Reviewer Matching for Anonymized Submissions | Anonymized paper submissions and reviewer profiles | Medium-term |

**Most Promising Use Case:** Paper Recommendation stands out as the most promising application due to its high feasibility and immediate impact on improving research discovery and accessibility. The model's ability to outperform existing recommenders and its applicability to recent scientific papers make it a valuable tool for researchers and academic platforms.
