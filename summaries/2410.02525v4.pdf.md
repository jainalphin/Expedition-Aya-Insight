## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Neural networks have recently become competitive with state-of-the-art models in retrieval tasks, primarily using a dual encoder architecture that encodes documents and queries into a dense latent space.
- **Problem:** While statistical models can incorporate prior corpus statistics like inverse document frequency (IDF), neural models struggle to integrate such context-dependent information, leading to challenges in adapting to new corpora at test time.
- **Methodology:**
  - **Contextual Document Embedding (CDE):** Proposes two methods for contextualized embeddings:
    - An alternative contrastive learning objective incorporating document neighbors into intra-batch contextual loss.
    - A new architecture encoding neighbor document information into the representation.
  - **Training:** Uses fast query-document clustering to group neighbors for each training batch, ensuring embeddings distinguish documents even in challenging contexts.
  - **Architecture:** Introduces a new encoder augmenting the standard BERT-style encoder with additional conditioning for aggregated document-level information about neighboring documents.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark for small models (<250M parameters) without hard negative mining or large batch sizes.
  - Significantly improves performance in highly specific domains like financial and medical documents.
  - Contextual batching and adversarial contrastive learning enhance performance, especially when combined.
  - Smaller cluster sizes and harder batches improve learning efficiency, particularly with false negative filtering.
- **Conclusion:** The proposed CDE method and architecture effectively integrate contextual information, improving retrieval performance across various domains and settings, especially in out-of-domain scenarios.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Contextual Document Embedding (CDE) | CDE is a novel method that integrates contextual information into document embeddings, enhancing their ability to handle retrieval tasks in specific contexts. |
| 2 | Adversarial Contrastive Learning | Reordering training data to create harder batches significantly improves learning, as demonstrated by a strong correlation between batch difficulty and downstream performance. |
| 3 | Impact of Context Size | The model's performance improves with a full context window size, but it can still perform reasonably with partial or no context, showcasing its robustness and adaptability. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
- **Contextualization**: Unlike traditional methods that treat documents in isolation, CDE incorporates neighboring documents, improving retrieval accuracy in specific domains.
- **Adversarial Training**: Previous work by Xiong et al. (2020) and Zhang & Stratos (2021) highlighted the benefits of hard negatives, but our method systematically reorders batches to maximize learning efficiency.
- **Context Size Flexibility**: While prior models often require full context, our approach maintains performance even with limited context, making it more versatile in resource-constrained settings.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$ \log p(d \vert q) = \exp f(d, q) \exp f(d, q) + \sum_{d' \notin S(q,d)} \exp f(d', q) $$ | This equation calculates the log probability of a document given a query, excluding elements of the equivalence class S(q, d) that are not definitively negative examples. | This equation is crucial for filtering out false negatives during training, which improves model accuracy by ensuring that only definitively negative examples are considered in the partition function. |
| $$ \max_{\phi,\psi} \sum_{j} \log p(d_j \vert q_j) \approx \sum_{j} \log \exp f(d_j, q_j) \sum_{d' \in H(q_j)} \exp f(d', q_j) $$ | This equation approximates the likelihood of the document corresponding to each query using contrastive learning, replacing the exact normalizer with a biased approximation calculated from negative samples. | This approximation is essential because computing the exact normalizer for large retrieval datasets is computationally infeasible. Contrastive learning allows the model to efficiently learn embeddings by focusing on distinguishing between positive and negative samples. |
| $$ \min_{B_1, ..., B_B} \sum_{b} \sum_{(d,q) \in B_b} m((d, q), m_b) $$ | This equation represents a centroid-based objective that upper-bounds the original objective, transforming the maximization problem into a minimization problem using L2 distance. | This reformulation allows the use of efficient clustering algorithms like K-Means, treating each data point as two separate vectors. It facilitates the search for the most challenging configuration of batches, improving the contrastive approximation and downstream performance. |
| $$ \phi(d'; D) = M_2(M_1(d_1), ..., M_1(d_J), E(d'_1), ..., E(d'_T)) $$ | This equation defines the contextualized embedding of a document, integrating contextual embedding sequences from neighboring documents into the second-stage embedding model. | This equation is central to the proposed Contextual Document Embedding (CDE) method, enabling the model to capture contextual information from neighboring documents. It enhances the embeddings' ability to handle retrieval tasks in specific contexts, improving performance across various domains. |
| $$ p(d \vert q) = \exp f(d, q) \sum_{d' \in D} \exp f(d', q) $$ | This equation computes the probability distribution over potential documents based on a scalar score function matching documents and queries. | This probabilistic formulation is fundamental to text retrieval methods, providing a basis for computing document embeddings. It underpins the use of vector-based methods (embedding models) in efficient retrieval, which is a key focus of the research. |
