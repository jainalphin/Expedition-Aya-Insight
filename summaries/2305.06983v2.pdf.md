## Abstract Summary

* **Background:** Large language models (LLMs) have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output.
* **Problem:** Most existing retrieval augmented LLMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential.
* **Methodology:** Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE) iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens.
* **Key Findings:**
    * FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
    * FLARE outperforms baselines with respect to all metrics.
    * Retrieving with the next sentence achieves significantly better results than with the previous context.
    * Triggering retrieval for 40%-80% of sentences usually leads to a good performance across tasks/datasets.
* **Conclusion:** FLARE is a generic method that can effectively retrieve additional information throughout the generation.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | FLARE (Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation) outperforms baselines | FLARE's superior performance across diverse tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of forward-looking active retrieval in improving retrieval quality and generating accurate, factually consistent outputs. |
| 2 | Active retrieval threshold θ significantly impacts performance | Optimal retrieval activation (30% ∼ 60% of sentences) balances information gathering and generation efficiency, avoiding noise and generation impediments. |
| 3 | Next-sentence retrieval is more effective than previous-context-based retrieval | Using the next sentence as a query better anticipates future content, improving retrieval relevance and reducing errors. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* FLARE's active retrieval approach improves upon passive retrieval methods by dynamically deciding when and what to retrieve, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
* Unlike previous-window or previous-sentence methods, FLARE's forward-looking retrieval better aligns with future generation intents, reducing noise and improving performance.
* FLARE eliminates the need for task-specific prompt engineering in question decomposition approaches, offering a more generalizable and efficient solution.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$\mathbf{y_t = LM([D_{qt}, x, y_{<t}])}$$ | Represents the generated tokens at step t, where the input to the language model (LM) is the concatenation of retrieved documents, user input, and previously generated output. | This equation is central to the active retrieval augmented generation framework, showing how the model integrates retrieved information with user input and previous generations to produce the current output. |
| $$\mathbf{qt = qry(x, y_{<t})}$$ | Defines the retrieval query at step t, formulated based on the user input and previously generated output. | This equation is crucial for determining what information to retrieve at each step, ensuring that the retrieval process is dynamically adjusted based on the ongoing generation. |
| $$\mathbf{qt = (\emptyset \text{ if all tokens of } \hat{s_t} \text{ have probs } \geq \theta \text{, mask}(\hat{s_t}) \text{ or } q_{gen}(\hat{s_t}) \text{ otherwise})}$$ | Describes the query formulation process, where queries are generated for low-confidence spans in the generated output. | This equation is essential for the confidence-based query formulation method, ensuring that retrieval is triggered only when necessary, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy. |
| $$\mathbf{y_t = (\hat{s_t} \text{ if all tokens of } \hat{s_t} \text{ have probs } \geq \theta \text{, } s_t = LM([D_{qt}, x, y_{<t}]) \text{ otherwise})}$$ | Determines whether to accept the generated sentence or retrieve additional information based on token probabilities. | This equation is vital for the confidence-based active retrieval mechanism, ensuring that retrieval is only performed when the model lacks confidence in its generation, thus balancing accuracy and computational cost. |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Iterative and adaptive retrieval** | Iterative retrieval and refinement has been studied in both text and code generation tasks. | FLARE differs from these methods in the granularity of generation and retrieval strategies. |
| **Browser-enhanced language models** | WebGPT and WebCPM train language models to interact with browsers to enhance factuality using reinforcement learning or supervised training. | FLARE is built on text-based retrievers but can be combined with a browser to potentially improve retrieval quality. |
| **Retrieval augmented language models** | Most existing retrieval augmented language models employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. | This paper provides a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, where methods actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. |

**Gap Addressed:**
* The paper tackles the limitation of existing retrieval augmented language models that only retrieve information once based on the input, which is insufficient for generating long texts where continually gathering information is essential.
