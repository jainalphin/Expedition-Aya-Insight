## Abstract Summary

* **Background:** News summarization in today's global scene can be daunting with its flood of multilingual content and varied viewpoints from different sources.
* **Problem:** Current studies often neglect such real-world scenarios as they tend to focus solely on either single-language or single-document tasks.
* **Methodology:** Unify Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual and Multi-document Summarization into a novel task, i.e., MCMS, which encapsulates the real-world requirements all-in-one.
* **Key Findings:**
    - Omissions and Conflicts mitigated, yet Redundancies persist.
    - Preferential performance in CRS with Protocol-guided Prompting.
* **Conclusion:** Our study presents the task of MCMS that unifies Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual and Multi-document Summarization to align better with the diverse needs in real-world scenarios.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Protocol-guided prompting outperforms direct summarization | Protocol-guided prompting demonstrates superior performance in both omission and conflict aspects as the model size increases. However, redundancy remains an issue. |
| 2 | KIS (Key Information Split) outperforms Summarize | KIS exhibits remarkable superiority over Summarize across all languages, indicating that the context after KIS is more comprehensible for LLMs. |
| 3 | CLP (Cross-lingual Prompting) outperforms direct translation | CLP demonstrates higher accuracy than Translate, illustrating that CLP can assist LLMs more effectively in achieving semantic alignment between languages. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* MCMS (Multi-lingual, Cross-lingual, and Multi-document Summarization) extends typical MDS tasks by incorporating multi-lingual usage and addressing challenges like omissions and conflicts.
* GLOBE SUMM is the first dataset for MCMS scenarios, offering high-quality summaries generated through protocol-guided prompting.
* The protocol-guided prompting method demonstrates performance close to or surpassing human annotators, reducing the burden of manual annotation.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$\text{Precision}^* = \frac{TP + FPP}{TP + FP}$$ | Calculates the modified precision metric | Accounts for false positive positives (FPP) to better evaluate the performance of protocol-guided prompting with GPT-4 |
| $$\text{Recall}^* = \frac{TP + FPP}{TP + FN}$$ | Calculates the modified recall metric | Incorporates FPP to provide a more accurate assessment of recall in the context of GPT-4's capabilities |
| $$F^*1 = 2 * \frac{\text{Precision}^* * \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$ | Computes the modified F1 score | Combines modified precision and recall to evaluate the overall performance of GPT-4 in identifying redundancies, omissions, and conflicts |
| $$\text{score}_{\text{lang}} = \frac{\text{count(entailed)}}{\text{count(sents)}} \cdot \frac{1}{|S|}$$ | Calculates the entailment score for each language | Measures the consistency of generated summaries with the original document, ensuring the summary accurately reflects the source content |
| $$\text{coverage} = \frac{\text{count(entailed)}}{\text{count(sents)}}$$ | Computes the coverage rate of a candidate summary | Assesses how much of the reference summary's key information is captured in the candidate summary, helping to evaluate omission |
| $$\text{NIC} = 1 - \frac{\text{coverage}}{\log(|\text{cand}|) * 10}$$ | Calculates the Normalized Inverse of Coverage (NIC) | Quantifies omission by measuring the inverse of coverage, with lower values indicating better performance |
| $$\text{score}_{\text{red}} = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{i} \max_{j \neq i} \text{Sim}(x_j, x_i)$$ | Computes the redundancy score | Evaluates semantic similarity between summary sentences to identify and quantify redundancy, with lower scores indicating less redundancy |
| $$\text{penalty} = \log(\text{count}(0) + e)$$ | Calculates the penalty for neglecting conflict resolution | Incorporates a punitive measure for unresolved conflicts in the summary, ensuring conflict resolution is prioritized |
| $$\text{score}_{\text{con}} = \frac{\text{count}(1)}{\text{count}(1 / -1) + \alpha * \text{penalty}}$$ | Computes the conflict score | Assesses the effectiveness of conflict resolution in the summary, considering both resolved and unresolved conflicts |

## Technical Details

| Component | Description | Key Configuration or Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| **Algorithm(s)** | Key Information Split (KIS) and Cross-lingual Prompting (CLP) | KIS: reduces the length of input by organizing key information from each document into several finely-grained sentences before summarizing the whole document set. CLP: captures the alignment from various input languages to target language. |
| **Model/Architecture** | Protocol-guided Prompting (PGP) | PGP: requires LLMs to follow the established guidelines in the protocol during summary generation. |
| **Implementation** | Python | tiktoken, nltk |
| **Performance** | ROUGE, Red, NIC, CRE | ROUGE: measures the overlap co-occurrence of n-grams between the candidate and reference summaries. Red: evaluates the degree of the semantic similarity between each summary sentences. NIC: captures Omission, as the inverse of a coverage of key information from reference summary. CRE: evaluates how well a candidate summary addresses conflict. |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-lingual Summarization** | Focused on single-language or single-document tasks | Unifies multi-lingual, cross-lingual, and multi-document summarization (MCMS) |
| **Cross-lingual Summarization** | Early work on pipeline methods | Introduces protocol-guided prompting (PGP) for high-quality summarization |
| **Multi-document Summarization** | Focused on redundancy reduction | Addresses omissions and conflicts in addition to redundancies |

**Gap Addressed:**
* Lack of a dataset encompassing multi-lingual, cross-lingual, and multi-document features for real-world scenarios.
* Inability of current LLMs to handle conflicts, omissions, and redundancies effectively in multi-document, multi-lingual contexts.
* Need for a method to evaluate and improve LLM performance in handling diverse perspectives and cultural biases in news articles.

## Practical Applications

| Domain/Industry | Potential Use Case or Application | Key Requirements or Dependencies | Feasibility/Timeline (e.g., Short/Med/Long term) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **News Media** | Summarizing multilingual news articles | Access to multilingual news datasets, large language models (LLMs) with cross-lingual capabilities, conflict resolution strategies | Medium term |
| **Academia** | Evaluating LLMs on multilingual and multi-document tasks | Benchmark datasets, computational resources for experiments | Short term |
| **Information Management** | Handling redundancies, omissions, and conflicts in real-world data | Protocols for error identification and resolution, LLMs with protocol understanding | Long term |

**Most Promising Use Case:** Summarizing multilingual news articles in the News Media domain stands out due to its immediate applicability and potential to enhance global information dissemination.

## Limitations & Future Work

**Limitations:**
* **Theoretical:** The absence of a dataset that encompasses the distinctive features of MCMS (multi-document, multi-lingual, same event) inhibits researchers from further study.
* **Methodological:** The recurrent nature of CRS means reference summaries can cover any truncation length within the document set, but this work does not extensively investigate the impact of document quantity and language diversity on the difficulty of MCMS.
* **Data-Related:** Budget constraints prevent further experimental results on the GPT-4 model.

**Future Work Suggestions:**
* Exploring how to group news reports about the same event is a worthwhile research endeavour.
* Investigate LLM's prejudices across various languages.
* Examine the superiority of the annotation method by comparing GPT-4's performance with human annotation.
