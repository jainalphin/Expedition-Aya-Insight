## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures.
- **Problem:** Providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems.
- **Methodology:** RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever.
- **Key Findings:**
  - RAG answers 70% correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and 68% using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders.
  - RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points.
  - RAG models obtain state-of-the-art results on open-domain QA.
  - RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.
- **Conclusion:** RAG could be employed in a wide variety of scenarios with direct benefit to society.

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions, WebQuestions, and CuratedTrec | Combining parametric and non-parametric memory with generation for knowledge-intensive tasks is beneficial. |
| 2 | RAG sets a new state of the art on all four open-domain QA tasks | RAG combines the generation flexibility of "closed-book" approaches with the performance of "open-book" retrieval-based methods. |
| 3 | RAG models generate more specific, diverse, and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline | Hybrid models that combine parametric and non-parametric memory can address issues like memory expansion, revision, and "hallucinations". |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* RAG outperforms REALM and T5+SSM without requiring expensive, specialized pre-training.
* RAG demonstrates that a re-ranker or extractive reader is not necessary for state-of-the-art performance, unlike the DPR QA system.
* RAG models are more factual and specific than BART for Jeopardy question generation, with human evaluators preferring RAG in 42.7% of cases compared to 7.1% for BART.

## Key Equations

| Equation | Purpose or Role in the Paper | Why It Matters to the Research |
|---|---|---|
| $$p_{\text{RAG-Token}}(y|x) \approx \prod_{i=1}^N \sum_{z \in \text{top-}k(p(\cdot|x))} p_\eta(z|x) p_\theta(y_i|x, z, y_{1:i-1})$$ | Defines the RAG-Token model's probability of generating a sequence $$y$$ given an input $$x$$. It marginalizes over the top-k retrieved documents for each token in the sequence. | This equation is central to the RAG-Token model, which is one of the key contributions of the paper. It demonstrates how the model combines retrieval and generation, allowing it to generate more specific and factually accurate responses by leveraging retrieved documents. |
| $$p_{\text{RAG-Sequence}}(y|x) \approx \sum_{z \in \text{top-}k(p(\cdot|x))} p_\eta(z|x) p_\theta(y|x, z)$$ | Defines the RAG-Sequence model's probability of generating a sequence $$y$$ given an input $$x$$. It marginalizes over the top-k retrieved documents for the entire sequence. | This equation is fundamental to the RAG-Sequence model, which is another key contribution of the paper. It shows how the model uses a single retrieved document to generate the complete sequence, differentiating it from the RAG-Token model. |
| $$p_\eta(z|x) \propto \exp(\mathbf{d}(z)^\top \mathbf{q}(x))$$ | Defines the retrieval component $$p_\eta(z|x)$$, which scores the relevance of a document $$z$$ to a query $$x$$. Here, $$\mathbf{d}(z)$$ and $$\mathbf{q}(x)$$ are dense representations of the document and query, respectively. | This equation is crucial for the retrieval mechanism in RAG models. It ensures that the most relevant documents are retrieved, which is essential for the model's ability to generate accurate and specific responses. |

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-Task Retrieval** | Prior work has shown that retrieval improves performance across a variety of NLP tasks when considered in isolation. | This work unifies previous successes in incorporating retrieval into individual tasks, showing that a single retrieval-based architecture is capable of achieving strong performance across several tasks. |
| **General-Purpose Architectures for NLP** | Prior work on general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks has shown great success without the use of retrieval. | This paper aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, unified architecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models. |
| **Memory-based Architectures** | Some work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over fact embeddings. | This paper's memory is comprised of raw text rather than distributed representations, which makes the memory both human-readable and human-writable, enabling dynamic updates to the model's memory by editing the document index. |
| **Retrieve-and-Edit Approaches** | Retrieve-and-edit style approaches retrieve a similar training input-output pair for a given input and then edit it to provide a final output. | This method shares similarities with retrieve-and-edit approaches but focuses on aggregating content from several retrieved pieces of content rather than lightly editing a retrieved item. |

**Gap Addressed:**
- This paper tackles the limitation of existing models in accessing and precisely manipulating knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive tasks, by introducing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model that combines pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation.

## Practical Applications

| Domain/Industry | Potential Use Case or Application | Key Requirements or Dependencies | Feasibility/Timeline (e.g., Short/Med/Long term) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open-domain question answering** | Answering open-domain questions | Access to a large external knowledge source | Short term |
| **Fact verification** | Verifying the accuracy of claims | Access to a reliable knowledge source | Short term |
| **Knowledge-intensive dialogue** | Generating factual text in dialogue models | Access to a large external knowledge source | Medium term |
| **Abstractive question answering** | Generating free-form, abstractive text to answer questions | Access to a large external knowledge source | Short term |
| **Jeopardy question generation** | Generating precise, factual Jeopardy questions | Access to a large external knowledge source | Short term |

**Most Promising Use Case:** Open-domain question answering has the highest potential impact and feasibility, as it is a common real-world application and the research demonstrates state-of-the-art results in this area.

## Limitations & Future Work

**Limitations:**
* **Theoretical:** Hybrid models combining parametric and non-parametric memory cannot easily expand or revise their memory, cannot straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations”.
* **Methodological:** In preliminary experiments, for some tasks such as story generation, the retrieval component would “collapse” and learn to retrieve the same documents regardless of the input.
* **Data-Related:** Wikipedia, or any potential external knowledge source, will probably never be entirely factual and completely devoid of bias.

**Future Work Suggestions:**
* Investigate if the two components can be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some other objective.
* Investigate how parametric and non-parametric memories interact and how to most effectively combine them.
* Explore the use of RAG techniques in settings such as Machine Translation and Semantic Parsing.
