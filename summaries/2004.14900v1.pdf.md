| **Keywords** | Multilingual Summarization, Dataset, Text Summarization, Cross-Lingual Analysis |

## Abstract Summary

- **Background:** Document summarization requires complex language abilities, and advances in deep learning applied to NLP have contributed to its rising popularity. Most datasets for summarization are in English, and the lack of multilingual data is partially addressed by transfer learning techniques.
- **Problem:** The dominance of English in large-scale corpora limits the study of language-specific phenomena and hinders the development of multilingual models.
- **Methodology:** The authors introduce MLSUM, a large-scale multilingual summarization dataset built from online news outlets. They compare models across languages and investigate performance variations.
- **Key Findings:**
  - MLSUM enables new research directions for text summarization.
  - Existing biases motivate the use of a multilingual dataset.
  - Performance varies across languages, with Russian being more challenging due to data limitations.
  - Pretrained models like M-BERT outperform others.
- **Conclusion:** MLSUM fills the gap for large-scale multilingual summarization data, allowing for the study of language-specific phenomena and improving model performance for low-resource languages.

## Methodology Summary

* **Study Design:** Experimental
* **Dataset(s):**
    * Source: Online newspapers
    * Size: 1.5M+ article/summary pairs in 5 languages (French, German, Spanish, Russian, Turkish)
    * Key Characteristics: Comparable data for all languages except Russian, which has ten times less training samples
    * Preprocessing: Limited to avoid biases, no sentence separators used, articles shorter than 50 words or summaries shorter than 10 words discarded
* **Techniques/Models:** Supervised and unsupervised methods, extractive and abstractive models, including TextRank, Pointer Generator, and M-BERT
* **Evaluation:**
    * Metrics: ROUGE, METEOR, novelty
    * Setup: Models trained and evaluated on chronological train/validation/test splits, with data from 2010-2018 for training and 2019 for validation and testing
* **Tools & Software:** OpenNMT implementation, BPE tokenization, Wayback Machine for archiving articles

## Key Results

| Finding # | Description of Result | Significance / Insight |
|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | MLSUM is the first large-scale multilingual summarization dataset, comprising over 1.5M article/summary pairs in French, German, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish. | Fills a gap in the field of automatic summarization by providing a large-scale multilingual dataset, enabling new research directions for the text summarization community. |
| 2 | Cross-lingual comparative analyses based on state-of-the-art systems highlight existing biases which motivate the use of a multilingual dataset. | The availability of MLSUM will enable future works to build metrics in a multilingual fashion, addressing the biases observed in existing summarization models. |
| 3 | Performance on Russian is comparatively low, explained by the abstractive nature of the corpus and the limited training data available for Russian. | Highlights the challenges in handling low-resource languages and the need for more diverse and comprehensive datasets to improve model performance across languages. |

**Comparison to Prior Work:**
* MLSUM is the first large-scale multilingual summarization dataset, unlike previous datasets that were primarily in English or had limited multilingual coverage.
* Unlike earlier efforts that relied on human translations or provided only evaluation data, MLSUM is built from online news outlets and contains article-summary pairs in multiple languages.
* The dataset's size and diversity enable more robust and generalizable models, addressing the limitations of smaller datasets like MultiLing which covers 40 languages but provides relatively few examples.

## Related Work

| Topic/Area | Previous Approaches | This Paper's Innovation / Difference |
|---|---|---|
| **Multilingual Text Summarization** | Several research works have focused on multilingual text summarization. Radev et al. (2002) developed MEAD, a multi-document summarizer that works for both English and Chinese. Litvak et al. (2010) proposed to improve multilingual summarization using a genetic algorithm. A community-driven initiative, MultiLing (Giannakopoulos et al., 2015), benchmarked summarization systems on multilingual data. | We release the first large-scale multilingual summarization dataset, MLSUM, which contains over 1.5M article-summary pairs in 5 languages: French, German, Spanish, Russian, and Turkish. |
| **Existing Summarization Datasets** | The vast majority of summarization datasets are in English. For Arabic, there exist the Essex Arabic Summaries Corpus (EASC) and KALIMAT, but they comprise only circa 1k and 20k samples, respectively. Pontes et al. (2018) proposed a corpus of a few hundred samples for Spanish, Portuguese, and French summaries. The only large-scale non-English summarization dataset is the Chinese LCSTS. | MLSUM is the first large-scale multilingual summarization dataset, providing a comparable amount of data for all languages, except for Russian, which has ten times fewer training samples. |
| **Model Performance and Biases** | Previous works reported a significant performance gap between English and target languages for tasks like classification and Question Answering. A similar approach has been proposed for summarization, obtaining lower performance than for English. | We report cross-lingual comparative analyses based on state-of-the-art systems, highlighting existing biases that motivate the use of a multilingual dataset. We observe that M-BERT always outperforms the Pointer Generator, but the ratio is not homogeneous across languages, which may be due to differences in language morphology. |

**Gap Addressed:**
* The lack of a large-scale multilingual summarization dataset has hindered the development of abstractive models for multilingual summarization and the study of language-specific biases in summarization models. MLSUM fills this gap by providing a large-scale multilingual dataset that enables new research directions for the text summarization community.

## Practical Applications

| Domain/Industry | Potential Use Case or Application | Key Requirements or Dependencies | Feasibility/Timeline (e.g., Short/Med/Long term) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Natural Language Processing** | Multilingual Text Summarization | Large-scale multilingual dataset, pre-trained multilingual language models | Short-term |
| **Machine Translation** | Cross-lingual Summarization | Automated translation of datasets, multilingual pre-trained models | Medium-term |
| **Information Retrieval** | Cross-lingual Information Retrieval | Multilingual summarization models, cross-lingual evaluation datasets | Long-term |
| **Question Answering** | Multilingual Question Answering | Multilingual training dataset, pre-trained multilingual models | Medium-term |
| **News and Media** | Multilingual News Summarization | Access to multilingual news articles, summarization models | Short-term |

**Most Promising Use Case:** Multilingual Text Summarization in Natural Language Processing has the highest potential impact due to the availability of large-scale multilingual datasets and pre-trained multilingual language models, making it feasible for short-term deployment.
